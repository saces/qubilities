# QUBILITIES

Utilities for qubes. Some scrips that are _useful for me_â„¢.


### Menus

I don't like the 'Add more shortcuts..' everywhere, so I removed them. Also
removing VMs sometimes leave some stale menu items...

`qumenuclean` does the trick.

`qumenuedit [vmname]` opens the menu dialog. If no vmname is given, a nice menu
let you choose one.

### Templates

`qulistot` list all currently unused templates (templates without assigned appvm)


### Misc

`qupull` - a helper script. Its doing things. Don't use it. Just don't.
It's here to show you a way how to fetch data from an AppVM to Dom0.
